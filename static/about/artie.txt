Artie Jordan is the IT Director for 2tor, Inc., an education services company that partners with preeminent institutions of higher education to deliver rigorous, selective degree programs online to students globally. He began his career as a consultant for an IT support startup servicing the greater Chicago area, and later worked as a systems administrator for a private equity firm implementing CRM and telephony platforms. Before joining 2tor he led the nationwide rollout of voice over IP phone systems for the Obama For America presidential campaign as a member of the headquarters IT team, and had the honor of being invited to work on the Obama-Biden Presidential Transition Project in Washington, DC as a member of the interim operations team.
